# React Native Native Module Linking Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development where native modules fail to link correctly.  The example uses a hypothetical library, `react-native-uncommon-library`, to illustrate the issue. The `bug.js` file shows how this might be integrated into a component. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a potential solution involving ensuring native module linking.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3.  Follow the instructions within `bugSolution.js` to observe the resolution process.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file, upon attempting to import and utilize the hypothetical `react-native-uncommon-library`, produces a runtime error due to missing native module linkage.
