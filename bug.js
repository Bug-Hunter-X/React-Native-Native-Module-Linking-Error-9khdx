This error occurs when you are using a library that has native modules and those modules have not been correctly linked to your project. This often happens when dealing with third-party libraries, especially when upgrading React Native versions or switching between iOS and Android platforms.  The error may not always point directly to the library causing the problem.  Here's an example involving a hypothetical library called `react-native-uncommon-library`:
```javascript
import UncommonLibrary from 'react-native-uncommon-library';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <UncommonLibrary />
    </View>
  );
};
```
The error will manifest during runtime, usually showing something like a `NativeModule` not found or a similar message indicating a missing native module.
