To fix the native module linking error, ensure you've correctly linked the native modules of `react-native-uncommon-library` (replace this with your actual library). The process varies based on your library and whether you're on iOS or Android.  Here's a general approach:

**1. Verify Installation:** Double-check the library's installation instructions, ensuring you followed all steps correctly including post-install configurations.

**2. Check Linking (iOS):** For iOS, you often need to run the following steps. Make sure you are in the ios folder after navigating to your project directory.  Remember to run `pod install` after any changes to the Podfile. Then, rebuild the project.

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

**3. Check Linking (Android):** For Android, you may need to add the library's native code to your `android/settings.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files.  Refer to the library's documentation for precise instructions.  Rebuild your Android project after making the necessary changes.

**4. Clean and Rebuild:** After making any changes to native code or the build configurations, always clean and rebuild your project to ensure the changes take effect.

**5. Examine Logs:** Carefully analyze the detailed error logs provided by React Native to identify the specific native module causing the problem. This detailed error message will often pinpoint the problematic library.

The `bugSolution.js`  would contain code nearly identical to `bug.js`, but it would be assumed that the steps above had been completed successfully. This illustrates that if this is not done, the error is not addressed and requires manual configuration as per the library's documentation.
